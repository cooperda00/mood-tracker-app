# Mood Tracker

This app was inspired by a common bullet journalling spread, where people track their mood over time using colors.
This was an early project I built using vanilla JavaScript and CSS. It includes data persistance using the local storage api instead of a database.

## Tech Used

- Webpack
- Babel
- Moment
- calendar-js
- jscolor
